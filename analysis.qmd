## From Monday's Class

### Background Information

Bertrand, Marianne and Sendhil Mullainathan. 2004. "Are Emily and Greg More Employable Than Lakisha and Jamal? A Field Experiment on Labor Market Discrimination." American Economic Review, 94 (4): 991â€“1013. Data cleaned and discussed in "Quantitative Social Science: An Introduction" by Kosuke Imai.

"We study race in the labor market by sending fictitious resumes to help-wanted ads in Boston and Chicago newspapers. To manipulate perceived race, resumes are randomly assigned African-American- or White-sounding names. White names receive 50 percent more callbacks for interviews. Callbacks are also more respon- sive to resume quality for White names than for African-American ones. The racial gap is uniform across occupation, industry, and employer size. We also find little evidence that employers are inferring social class from the names. Differential treatment by race still appears to still be prominent in the U.S. labor market."

### Discussion

Subject: Discrimination

Broad question: Race and employment in the United States

Specific question: Effect of racially-coded names on call-backs

Preceptor Table: 
  
  * Units: individuals (or resumes ?) 
  
  * (Potential) Outcomes: call-back if black name, call-back if white name   
  
  * Causal/predictive: a causal model  
  
  * Covariates: sex, zip code (not shown in table)  
  
  * Treatment: black name on resume versus white name on resume 

## Example Preceptor Table
  
```{r}
tibble(ID = c("1", "2", "...", "10", "11", "...", "N"),
       attitude_after_control = c("Yes*", "No", "...", "No*", "Yes*", "...", "Yes"),
       attitude_after_treated = c("Yes", "Yes*", "...", "No", "Yes", "...", "No*"),
       treatment = c("Black", "White", "...", "Black", "Black", "...", "White")) |>
  
  gt() |>
  tab_header(title = "Preceptor Table") |> 
  cols_label(ID = md("ID"),
             attitude_after_control = md("Callback if White Name"),
             attitude_after_treated = md("Callback if Black Name"),
             treatment = md("Treatment")) |>
  tab_style(cell_borders(sides = "right"),
            location = cells_body(columns = c(ID))) |>
  tab_style(style = cell_text(align = "left", v_align = "middle", size = "large"), 
            locations = cells_column_labels(columns = c(ID))) |>
  cols_align(align = "center", columns = everything()) |>
  cols_align(align = "left", columns = c(ID)) |>
  fmt_markdown(columns = everything()) |>
  tab_spanner(label = "Potential Outcomes", columns = c(attitude_after_control, attitude_after_treated)) |>
  tab_spanner(label = "Covariate", columns = c(treatment))
```

## Questions for Second Class

<!-- There are no "right" answers. Each person/group might have a different goal . . . -->

> What are the units, precisely?

the individual resumes from 2024 with names associated with race in us

> What is the moment in time, precisely?

2024

> What is one reason why validity might not hold?

if a name can be percieved as black and white
People from boston are differennt from people elsewhere

<!-- Assume validity holds, and we can create the Population Table -->

> Describe the Population Table in words

row for each resume, columns are callback if white, callback if black, treatment/control

> What is one reason why stability might not hold?

names can have different meaning overtime. 
how people much people need jobs at that time vs now
resume might look different compared to now
company want to hire diverse people

> What is one reason why representativeness might not hold?

boston and chicago might not represent the whole US

> What is one reason why unconfoundedness might not hold?

number of white names vs black names
one of the type of names got better resumes than the other

> Describe in words what the Preceptor Table would look like if we were trying to, instead, predict whether or not someone would get a callback?

one potential outcome: callback
covariate: race

<!-- If time, load up and explore the data.  -->

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

x <- read_csv("data/resume.csv")
x
```
